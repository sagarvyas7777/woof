    <h2>27 April, 2023</h2>
	
	<p>To Guneet Dang,
    <p>So, it all started on 7th April, 2023 when we drank a bottle of Nishijin sake and I went through your snaps. Not going to lie, I always liked you for your enthusiasm for playing games, staying up late, and your drinking capacity. I like your energy, vibe, and how you are always in a jovial mood and ready to go to the beach or to play/eat outside.</p>
	<p>The Japan trip was very special to me as it brought us closer. I enjoyed staying up late with you and having someone with similar interests and IQ as myself. You are like sunshine on a rainy day. You make everything better and you are the person that gets me so involved in the moment that I don't need anything else.</p>
	<p>I like you and I want you to be my girlfriend. I know it will be weird with all of our mutual friends and the relationship you had with him but everything will get better with time.</p>
	<p>"Patience is a virtue" Somebody taught me that. And, most importantly I like you for who you are as a person and your vibe, not just because of chipmunks, I swear.</p>
	<p>Thank you for being there for me and teaching me new things everyday.</p>
	<p>Yours truly,</p>
	<p>Sagar Vyas</p>
